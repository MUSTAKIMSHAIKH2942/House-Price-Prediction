# House Price Prediction Web Application

This is a web application built using Flask for predicting house prices based on user-inputted features. The application leverages machine learning models to provide accurate price predictions based on a dataset of house attributes.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for inputting house details.
- Model selection between Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Dynamic input fields based on the dataset.
- Missing value handling using median imputation.
- Real-time house price predictions based on user input.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas
- **Environment**: Virtualenv

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   
## Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

.venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate
Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
## Download the dataset:

Place the dataset (e.g., train.csv) in the appropriate directory as specified in the code.
Usage
Run the application:


python app.py
Access the web app: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Input House Details:

Select the model type.
Fill in the required house features (e.g., LotFrontage, LotArea, MSSubClass).
Click on "Predict Price" to get the predicted house price.
How It Works
User Input: Users input house attributes via a web form.
Data Imputation: Missing values in the dataset are handled using median imputation.
Model Selection: The user selects a machine learning model for prediction.
Model Training: The chosen model is trained on the dataset.
Prediction: The model predicts the house price based on the input provided.
Display Result: The predicted price is displayed on the same web page.
